*Update 25 March 2017: the latest version is out with preliminary support of GNOME 3.24*

## Flat-Plat-Blue Theme

Flat-Plat-Blue Theme is a GNOME Shell/GTK Theme forked from [Flat-Plat Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) with the following refinements:

* All coloured elements (e.g. check boxes, sliders, switches, etc) are changed into blue to provide a more consistent and comfortable visual experience;
* The top bar is transparent (this theme can be used in conjunction with GNOME Shell Extension "[Dynamic Panel Transparency](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1011/dynamic-panel-transparency/)");
* Open Sans is the default font of the theme; and
* Other minor changes and fixes.

The latest version now includes three variants:

* **Dark** title bar and **light** window's background (Flat-Plat-Blue)
* **Light** title bar and **light** window's background (Flat-Plat-Blue-Light)
* **Dark** title bar and **dark** window's background (Flat-Plat-Blue-Dark)

Each variant comes with **normal** and **compact** themes for different screen sizes.

## The Origin Story

I forked and modified the [Flat-Plat Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat) for personal use, but I reckoned there were people out there who wanted a [colour scheme that was more comfortable to look at](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/issues/19), so I put together the theme and release it. You are welcomed to fork it and make further modifications yourself.
