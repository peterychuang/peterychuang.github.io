      <description>And yet in our world everybody thinks of changing humanity, and nobody thinks of changing himself.
&amp;mdash; Leo Tolstoy, Three Methods Of Reform
 This is one of the most quotable quotes by Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact context of that quote, but since nobody cares, so I will leave it aside for now.
I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure, though, how many of us do intend to change the world.</description>
