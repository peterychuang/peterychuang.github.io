      <description>As a lifelong listener of classical music, and orchestral music and operas in particular, the importance of having a decent audio system has become known to me for as long as I have been listening to music. When I was small, I used to play compact discs (CDs) recordings on a small audio system, which, as one would expect, did no justice to the recordings. Later, I convinced my parents to upgrade the audio system at home to a beginner&amp;rsquo;s level high-fidelity system, with an integrated amplifier and a pair of bookshelf-style speakers, which, of course, probably weren&amp;rsquo;t very good, but I was able to enjoy it for some years.</description>
