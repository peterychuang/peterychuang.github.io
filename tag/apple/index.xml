      <description>As a full-time Linux user, I have never cared much about Apple products. All of my previous computers were PCs that came with Microsoft Windows, which I invariably removed before putting Linux on it. Apple products are overpriced, and installing Linux on MacBooks is, in general, trickier than on an average PC, so I have looked away from MacBooks for years.
Then my Dell XPS 13 died, and I discovered that Dell had terrible service in my part of the world, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it repaired.</description>
