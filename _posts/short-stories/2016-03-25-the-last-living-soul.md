I knew. For a long time, I knew I was in part a creation of someone called the scientist. Since the scientist was responsible for the existence of me and others of my own type, a few of us regarded the scientist with a god-like reverence, while others held him/her in utter contempt. No one knew him/her: there was no photograph, painted portrait, nor busts of the scientist, and we had no idea regarding his/her name, and whether this person was a man or woman.

I was told that lives in general were the most difficult in the last few million years. But what do I know? I knewnothing about the last few million years to be able to judge. So when my mother told me so, I nodded, not out of my agreement, but out of my respect, and I suspected she didn’t actually know either. She was not my real mother in the former sense of the word. Even though I had lived inside the womb of my mother, I had no relation to her whatsoever, and so as all of my own type. She didn’t even bother to give me a proper name, but instead call me Zero Zero Zero One.
