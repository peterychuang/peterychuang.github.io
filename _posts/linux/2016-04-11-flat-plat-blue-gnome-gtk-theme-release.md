## Flat-Plat-Blue Theme

Flat-Plat-Blue Theme is a Gnome Shell/GTK Theme forked from [Flat-Plat Theme][3] with the following refinements:

* All coloured elements (e.g. check boxes, sliders, switches, etc) are changed into blue to provide a more consistent and comfortable visual experience;
* The top bar is now transparent;
* Open Sans is now the default font of the theme; and
* other minor changes and fixes

*(Scroll down for screenshots)*

I forked and modified the [Flat-Plat Theme][3] for personal use, but I reckoned there were people out there who wanted a [colour scheme that was more comfortable to look at][4], so I decided to put together the theme and open-source it. You are welcomed to fork it and make further modifications yourself.


### Installation
1. [Download Flat-Plat-Blue for Gnome 3.20 Here][2]
2. Extract the files from the archive
3. Copy the Flat-Plat-Blue Folder to /usr/share/themes/ using the following command:

        sudo cp -r path/to/Flat-Plat-Blue /usr/share/themes
4. Use Gnome Tweak Tool to enable both the GTK+ Theme and the Shell Theme
5. Profit!
